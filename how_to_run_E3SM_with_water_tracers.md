# Running E3SM with source-aware numerical water tracers

## General information

iE3SM is a version of the Department of Energy Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2.1 (E3SM v2.1) that provides a source-aware water tagging capability. By defining source regions using the `setup_sim.py` tool, the user can define as many regions as desired for any latitude and longitude bounds. See Audette et al. (2026) for more details. 

[Audette, A., Feldl, N., Singh, H., Heyblom, K., Wang, H., Nusbaumer, J., et al. (2026). Numerical water tracers in the atmospheric component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model: Implementation and changes in moisture origin. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 18, e2025MS005287.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025MS005287)

## Getting the code

Clone the water tracer fork of E3SM:

```bash
git clone -b ie3sm1.0 --recursive https://github.com/AlexAudette/E3SM.git ~/E3SM_wtrc
cd E3SM_wtrc
```

If you are on Perlmutter, no further machine configuration is needed. If you are on another machine, it is recommended to first install and validate the `maint-2.1` branch of the standard E3SM to confirm your machine is set up correctly before switching to this fork. See the [General E3SM information](#general-e3sm-information) section for instructions on how to do this.

## Creating a new case

### 1. Define your case directory

Set a variable pointing to where your case will live. On Perlmutter, my cases are stored under `/global/cfs/cdirs/<project>/<username>/E3SM_simulations`:

```bash
export CASEDIR="/global/cfs/cdirs/<project>/<username>/E3SM_simulations/<casename>"
```

### 2. Create the case

Run `create_newcase` from the E3SM `cime/scripts` directory:

```bash
/global/homes/<initial>/<username>/E3SM_wtrc/cime/scripts/create_newcase --case $CASEDIR --compset 1850SOI_EAM%CMIP6_ELM%SPBC_MPASSI_MPASO_MOSART_SGLC_SWAV --res ne30pg2_EC30to60E2r2 --mach pm-cpu --project m4426
```

The key options are:

| Option | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--case` | `$CASEDIR` | Path where the case directory will be created |
| `--compset` | `1850SOI_EAM%CMIP6_...` | Pre-industrial control compset with the EAM atmosphere and MPAS ocean/ice |
| `--res` | `ne30pg2_EC30to60E2r2` | Atmosphere at ~1° (ne30pg2) with the EC30to60 MPAS ocean mesh |
| `--mach` | `pm-cpu` | Perlmutter CPU partition |
| `--project` | `m4426` | Compute allocation to charge |

### 3. Configure the water tracers with `setup_sim.py`



The `iE3SM_utils/` directory contains the Python tooling that automates all water tracer configuration. It should be ran form within the `iE3SM_utils/` directory — it writes directly into `$CASEDIR`, which is passed as a command-line argument.

#### What it does

Running `setup_sim.py` performs three steps automatically:

1. **Writes `user_nl_eam`** — generates the EAM namelist with tracer names, isotope ratios, and output field lists (`fincl1`/`fincl2`), writing it to `$CASEDIR/user_nl_eam`.
2. **Patches `atm_import_export.F90`** — inserts the tracer source definition block (geographic bounds and flux assignments) into `$CASEDIR/SourceMods/src.eam/atm_import_export.F90`.
3. **Runs `xmlchange` commands** — configures the run length, resubmission count, wall-clock time, and archiving settings for the case.

#### Directory structure


```
iE3SM_utils/                          ← run scripts from here
├── setup_sim.py
├── tracer_config.py
├── namelist.py
├── f90_patch.py
├── xml_config.py
├── tracer_configuration.json       ← edit this to define your tracers
└── run_config.json                 ← edit this to set run length, wallclock, etc.

$CASEDIR/                           ← files will be written here
├── SourceMods/
│   └── src.eam/
│       └── atm_import_export.F90   ← will be patched by setup_sim.py
└── user_nl_eam                     ← will be written by setup_sim.py
```

#### Configuration

Before running, review and edit the two JSON files:

**`tracer_configuration.json`** — defines the water tracer regions. `H2O` must always be the first entry. Add or modify regional tags (e.g. `ARC`, `ROW`) with their latitude/longitude bounds and isotope ratios. Here are examples for the two tracers describing the moisture evaporated from the Arctic and from the rest of the world:

```json
{
    "H2O": {
        "lat_bounds": [-90, 90],
        "rstd": 1.0,
        "description": "Bulk water reference. Required in every water tracer run."
    },
    "ARC": {
        "lat_bounds": [70, 90],
        "rstd": 0.003,
        "description": "Arctic water vapour"
    },
    "ROW": {
        "lat_bounds": [-90, 70],
        "rstd": 0.997,
        "description": "Rest of world water vapour"
    }
}
```

**`run_config.json`** — controls the CESM case settings:

```json
{
    "resubmit": 5,
    "stop_n": 5,
    "stop_option": "nyears",
    "wallclock": "48:00:00",
    "dout_s": true
}
```

#### Configure the water tracer files

From the `iE3SM_utils/` directory, pass `$CASEDIR` as an argument:

```bash
python setup_sim.py $CASEDIR
```

The script will print a confirmation line for each step as it completes:

```
Written user_nl_eam
Patched SourceMods/src.eam/atm_import_export.F90 successfully.
Running: ./xmlchange --append CAM_CONFIG_OPTS=-water_tracer h2o -water_tag_num <N_WTRC>
Running: ./xmlchange RESUBMIT=5
...
```

Once this has completed without errors, the case is fully configured and ready to set up and build:

### 4. Set up and build the case

```bash
cd "${CASEDIR}"
```
At this point you might want to adjust the `$CASEDIR/env_mach_pes.xml` which contains the PE layout for the run. You can always change it later, but you will need to recall the `case.setup` script with the `--reset` option, which will reset the `JOB_WALLCLOCK_TIME` variable in `env_workflow.xml`. 


```bash
./case.setup

./case.build
```

At this point, the model should have built sucessfully and the console should show a message indicating so. The case is now ready to be submitted to the queue or ran interactively on an interactive compute node (not recommended). 


### 5. Submit the case

```bash
./case.submit
```

This will submit the job to the queue.

## General E3SM information

### Getting the standard E3SM code

```bash
git clone -b maint-2.1 --recursive https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM.git
cd E3SM
```

Available branches include `maint-1.0`, `maint-1.1`, `maint-1.2`, `maint-2.0`, and `maint-2.1`. Do not use `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archives from GitHub — they do not include the submodule code. `maint-2.1` is the release from which this project is branched from. Submodules such as CIME have not been modified in iE3SM, and are maintained by the E3SM team. 

### Input data

On supported platforms (including Perlmutter), all required input data is already available in world-readable local directories. On unsupported machines, do not attempt to download all input data at once — the CIME case control system will automatically fetch any missing files from the E3SM input data server (`https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/`) or the CESM input data server as each case requires them.
